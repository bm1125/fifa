Football predictions using team rankings by EA

Following this: https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-premier-league-odds-from-ea-player-bfdb52597392

I plan to evnetually test this Idea. I have also uploaded my final file for this idea. It is in the data folder under the name
final.csv .
In this file, each row represent a match with the 0-35 first cells values are the player-api of the api service I have used (api-football.com) . The problem is that there are too many players missing in the fifa players datasets that has been uploaded on kaggle. So I plan to scrape all players from sofifa.com by myself and then try it again.
