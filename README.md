Football predictions using team rankings by EA

I came across this article https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-premier-league-odds-from-ea-player-bfdb52597392 and wanted to reproduce the results.

I encountered some problems with fifa players dataset that is available on kaggle so for now I decided to scrape myself team rankings (def, mid, att, overall) and see if a neural network predictions could be valuable. Later on I plan on adding more paremeters to each team and maybe building my own players dataset and using it in the same way as in the article above.

I've built two packages to make it easier for me handling the data on jupyter notebook. In the notebook I have uploaded here there's detailed explanation about each package and its methods.
